## Abstract

This paper proposes "Delta Compression," a novel approach to achieving highly efficient information compression by representing information not as static data, but as a parameter delta generated by a hypernetwork. The full paper details experiments including a large-scale PoC on a Llama-3-8B model.

## About this Repository

To ensure broad accessibility and reproducibility, this repository contains the LoRA adapter, dataset, and inference script for the **small-scale experiment** described in Section 4.1 of the paper.

This specific experiment demonstrates that a minimal LoRA adapter (approx. 390KB) can store and perfectly reconstruct 70,000 tokens of diverse Japanese texts using the `cyberagent/open-calm-1b` model.

## How to Reproduce the Results

This project is designed and verified to run on Google Colab.

1.  **Click the "Open in Colab" badge** at the top of this page.
2.  A new notebook will open in Google Colab.
3.  Run the cells sequentially from top to bottom. The notebook will automatically clone this repository, install dependencies, and run the inference to generate the 70 texts, demonstrating the perfect reconstruction from the provided LoRA adapter.
